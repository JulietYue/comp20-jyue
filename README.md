##Purpose of this Git repository
To hold assignments and labs done for COMP20-Web Programming class so that they can be shared with Ming privately and easily. 

##Favorite lab/assignment
Assignment 2, NotUber. I learned how to use javascript, use Google map API, and interacting with server in one assignment.

##How much have I grown
I have a better understanding of how the internet works. I am introduced to security, a topic which is the most distant from what I have learned before. I am now able to make simple web application and interact with various APIs.

##Most important lesson learned
Cyber security is now a big issue not only in national level but in our everyday life.
- Cyber scurity should be a basic knowledge for every developer but most developers aren't taught of the topic
- Most websites do not have enough measures to counter cyber attack. Some company are still storing passwords in the database without encoding

##Further study
I would like to know more about secruity
